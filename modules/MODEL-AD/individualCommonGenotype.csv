individualCommonGenotype,"Genotype of animal that includes LOAD1 or LOAD2 terminology LOAD1 = APOE4_HOMOZYGOUS; TREM2R47H_HOMOZYGOUS and LOAD2 = APOE4_HOMOZYGOUS; TREM2R47H_HOMOZYGOUS; ABETA_HOMOZYGOUS. LOAD1 is a mouse strain that has two copies of the APOE4 gene and two copies of the Trem2R47H gene. The APOE4 gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and the Trem2R47H gene is a modifier of the risk of Alzheimer's disease. LOAD2 is a mouse strain that has two copies of the APOE4 and Trem2R47H genes, as well as two copies of the Abeta gene. The Abeta gene is a protein that is thought to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Both LOAD1 and LOAD2 mice are more likely develop Alzheimer's disease at a younger age than mice with other genotypes. This makes the LOAD1 and LOAD2 genotypes valuable tools for studying the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.","LOAD1, LOAD2, LOAD1.ABCA7A1527G, LOAD1.CEACAM1KO, LOAD1.Clasp2L163P, LOAD1.CR1long, LOAD1.Il1rapExon2KO, LOAD1.MthfrC677T, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L, LOAD1.Snx1D465N, 5XFAD, APOE4, Trem247H, Trem2KO, C57BL6J, Trem2R47H_NSS, 5XFADTrem2R47H_NSS, AppAbeta_LoxP, PicalmH458R, Bin1K358R, Abca7V1599M, Spi1rs1377416",,,False,ManifestColumn,,sage.annotations-neuro.individualCommonGenotype-0.0.5,,string,MODEL-AD
