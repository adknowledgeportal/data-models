cellHashing,"Cell Hashing uses oligo-tagged antibodies against highly expressed surface proteins to place a 'sample barcode' on each single cell, enabling different samples to be multiplexed together and run in a single experiment",,,,,libraryPrep,,https://cite-seq.com/cell-hashing/,,string,sequencing
Chromium Single Cell 3',"10x 3' v3 is the third version of the 10x sequencing technology that sequences from the 3' end of nucleic acid molecules. In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer.",,,,,libraryPrep,,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pcl/individuals?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FPCL_0016452,,string,sequencing

proximity ligation,"Proximity ligation technologies are based on the ability to crosslink two genomic loci that are in close physical proximity to each other in the nuclear space. The crosslinked chromatin is then subjected to restriction enzyme digestion, which fragments the genomic DNA. The digested chromatin is re-ligated so that regions that are crosslinked together (intra-molecular re-ligation) are attached to each other. This process produces libraries of chimeric DNA products, including adjacent restriction fragments, which are normally found at different positions along the linear genome.",,,,,libraryPrep,,https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/144/20/3646/48125/The-three-dimensional-genome-regulating-gene,,string,sequencing
