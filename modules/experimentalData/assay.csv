whole-cell patch clamp,"A patch-clamp assay where the electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but the membrane patch has been perforated, providing access from the interior of the pipette to the intracellular space of the cell. Measurements made with this technique involve recording currents through multiple channels simultaneously, over the membrane of the entire cell.",,,,,assay,,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0002178,,string,experimentalData
