## Production data model
**AD.model.\* ([csv](https://github.com/adknowledgeportal/data-models/blob/main/AD.model.csv) | [jsonld](https://github.com/adknowledgeportal/data-models/blob/main/AD.model.jsonld))**: this is the current, "live" version of the AD Portal data model. It is being used by both the staging and production versions of the multitenant Data Curator App.

* production DCA: https://dca.app.sagebionetworks.org/
* staging DCA (used by FAIR Data team to test updates to app infrastructure and schematic package): https://dca-staging.app.sagebionetworks.org/

## Editing data models

:warning: Do **not** edit `AD.model.csv` or `AD.model.jsonld` by hand! :warning:

### Github branch procedure:

The main branch of this repo is protected, so you cannot push changes to main. To make changes to the data model:
1. Create a new branch in this repo and give it an informative name. The schema-convert workflow will not work from a private fork.
2. On that branch, make and commit any changes. You can do this by cloning the repo locally or by [using a Github codespace](#developing-in-a-codespace). Please write informative commit messages in case we need to track down data model inconsistencies or introduced bugs.
3. Open a pull request and request review from someone else on the AD DCC team. The Github Action described in [Automation](#automation) will run as soon as you open the PR. If this action fails, something about the data model csv could not be converted to a json-ld and should be investigated. If this action passes, the PR can be merged with one approving review.
4. After the PR is merged, delete your branch.

### Editing attributes by module:

The full `AD.model.csv` file has over 1400 attributes and is unwieldy to edit and hard to review changes for. For ease of editing, the full data model is divided into "module" subfolders, like so:

```
data-models/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AD.model.csv (do not edit!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AD.model.jsonld (do not edit!)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ biospecimen/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specimenID.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ organ.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tissue.csv
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sequencing/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ readLength.csv
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ platform.csv
```
Within each module, every attribute in the data model where `Parent` = `ManifestColumn` has its own csv, named after that attribute (example: `organ.csv`). Any valid values of the attribute "organ" have `Parent` = `organ` and are listed as rows in the file `organ.csv`. Attributes with `Parent` = `ManifestColumn` are used as columns in metadata and annotation manifest templates. Attributes with `Parent` = `ManifestTemplate` describe the templates themselves. At this time, any other value for `Parent` means the attribute is a valid value of some other enumerated attribute. 

Some common data model editing scenarios are:

#### Adding a new valid value to an existing manifest column: 
1. If you wanted to add a new valid value "eyeball" to our existing column attribute "organ", after making a new branch and opening the repo either locally or within a codespace, you would go to `modules/biospecimen/organ.csv`.
2. Then, create a new row for an attribute named "eyeball", with a description and source (preferably an ontology URI). In the `Parent` column, make sure the value is "organ".
3. Next, find the row for the attribute "organ" (should be the first row), and w/in the valid values column, add "eyeball" to the comma-separated list of valid values.
4. Save your changes and write an informative commit. Please try to add valid values alphabetically!
   
#### Adding a new column to a manifest template: 
1. If you wanted to add the column "furColor" to the "model-ad_individual_animal_metadata" template, first decide which module the new column should belong to. In this case, "MODEL-AD" makes the most sense.
2. W/in the `MODEL-AD` subfolder, create a new csv called `furColor.csv` with the required schematic column headers. Describe the attribute "furColor" as necessary and make sure `Parent` = `ManifestColumn`. Add any valid values for "furColor" as new rows to this csv as described in the previous scenario.
3. Find the manifest template attributes in `modules/template/templates.csv`. In the "model-ad_individual_animal_metadata" row, add your new column "furColor" to the comma-separated list of attributes in the `DependsOn` column.
4. Save your changes and write an informative commit.

#### Adding a new template to the data model:
1. If you wanted to add a new template to the data model, first add the template to the bottom of the 'template.csv' file, with the column names in the order they will appear.
      Example: 'assay_spatialTranscriptomics_metadata_template,SysBio spatial transcriptomics metadata template schema,,"Component, individualID, biospecimenID, fileFormat, sequenceAnalysis, runID, captureArea, readIndicator, spatialRead1, spatialRead2",,False,ManifestTemplate,,sysbio.metadataTemplates-assay.spatialTranscriptomics,,,template'
3. Next, add the new template name to the bottom of the dca-template-config.json.
      Example:
        '"display_name": "assay_spatialTranscriptomics_metadata_template",
        "schema_name": "AssaySpatialTranscriptomicsMetadataTemplate",
        "type": "record"'
5. Stage, commit, and open a PR with these two changes, requesting review by another AD data manager. Once approved and merged, a GitHub Action workflow will run that uploads the new template to the AD Metadata Dictionary site. Note: the GitHub Actions to join the modules and convert to a json-ld data model, and to generate a test template to review take a few minutes to complete. You will know when they are complete with a green check. The GitHub Action to upload the new template to the AD Metadata Dictionary site takes roughly 1.5 hours to complete.

For more advanced data modeling scenarios like adding conditional logic, creating validation rules, or creating new manifests, please consult the #ad-dcc-team slack channel.

### Notes on collaboratively editing csvs

A persistent issue is that manually editing csvs is challening. Some columns in our modules are very short, and others are veeeeery long (Description, Valid Values). Some options for working on csvs, and their pros and cons:

- Editing in the Github UI :octocat: : convenient, but challenging to keep track of columns in plain text format. 
- Cloning the repo, making a branch, and opening csvs locally in Excel or another spreadsheet program üñ•Ô∏è : probably the best UI experience, but involves a few extra steps with git.
- Using a [Github codespace](#developing-in-a-codespace) to launch VSCode in the browser, and editing with the pre-installed RainbowCSV extension üåà : Still difficult to edit csvs as plain text, but the color formatting and ability to use a soft word wrap makes it much easier to distinguish columns. [RainbowCSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) lets you designate "sticky" rows and columns for easier scrolling, and also has a nice "CSVLint" function that will check for formatting errors after you make changes.

We are exploring better solutions to this problem -- if you have ideas, tell us!

## Automation

When you open a PR that includes any changes to files in the `modules/` directory, a Github Action will automatically run before merging is allowed. This action:
1. Runs the `assemble_csv_data_model.py` script to concatenate the modular attribute csvs into one data frame, sort alphabetically by `Parent` and then `Attribute`, and write the combined dataframe to `AD.model.csv`. The action then commits the changes to the master data model csv.
2. Installs the latest version of `schematic` from PyPi and runs `schema convert` on the newly-concatenated data model csv to generate a new version of the jsonld file `AD.model.jsonld`. The action also commits the changes to the jsonld.
3. Collects the names of any module attributes or templates changed by your PR, then uses the schematic CLI to generate Google sheet versions of those templates.
4. Makes a new comment in the PR consisting of an Rmd report with the template generation status and link to each template, so you can physically view the new template and verify that any changes you made look as intended.
5. Due to branch protection rules set on the `main` branch, a branch called `update-manifests` containing the updated manifests is created, and a PR is automatically generated for a member of the repo to review and manually merge afterwards.

If this automated workflow fails, then the data model may be invalid and further investigation is needed. 
   
## Developing in a codespace

:warning: If you are working in a Github Codespace, do NOT commit any Synapse credentials to the repository and do NOT use any real human data when testing data model function. This is not a secure environment!

If you want to make changes to the data model and test them out by generating manifests with `schematic`, you can use the devcontainer in this repo with a Github Codespace. This will open a container in a remote instance of VSCode and install the latest version of schematic. The devcontainer also installs the Rainbow CSV extension. You can make changes, commit them, and open a PR from the codespace. 

Codespace secrets: 
- SYNAPSE_PAT: scoped to view and download permissions on the sysbio-dcc-tasks-01 Synapse service account
- SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS: these are creds for using the Google sheets api with schematic
- GENERATE_MANIFESTS_ON_ACTION: this fine-grained PAT lets manifests be successfully generated despite branch protection, has read/write access to actions, and has repo access to adknowledgeportal/data-models 

## Legacy data models:
Previous versions of the data model live in the `legacy-data-models/` folder. This include the Diverse Cohorts pilot model and the intial "legacy" model representing the AD Portal Synapse project metadata dictionary and metadata templates from August 2023. These are not being used by DCA.
