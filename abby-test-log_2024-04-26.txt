Converting data model to JSON-LD
By default, the JSON-LD output will be stored alongside the first input CSV or JSON-LD file. In this case, it will appear here: 'AD.model.jsonld'. You can use the `--output_jsonld` argument to specify another file path.
The Data Model was created and saved to 'AD.model.jsonld' location.
