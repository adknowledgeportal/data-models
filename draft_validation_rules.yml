### trying out a more involved serialization structure for validation rules based on types, targets, etc
### not used for now

data_model: AD.model.csv
attribute:
  display_name: individualID
  validation_rules: 

    - rule: matchExactlyOne
      # one of: cross-manifest, content, list, regex, url, type, required
      intended effect: all individualIDs in individual metadata templates much match the Individual Key
      rule_type: cross-manifest
      # cross manifest only: this rule is applied when the attribute is in the following manifests:
      rule_manifest: 
        - IndividualHumanMetadataTemplate
        - IndividualAnimalMetadataTemplate
        - IndividualAnimalMODEL-ADMetadataTemplate
      # cross manifest only: the attribute in the rule manifest is validated against the following target manifests:
      target_manifest:
        - IndividualKey
      # cross manifest only: the attribute in the rule manifest is validated against the following attribute in the target manifest(s)
      target_attribute: 
      # cross manifest only: the scope of the rule (set or value)
      rule_scope: set
      # level of exception to raise (error or warning)
      level: error

    - rule: unique
      rule_type: content
      rule_manifest: IndividualKey
    - rule: required
      rule_type: requirement
